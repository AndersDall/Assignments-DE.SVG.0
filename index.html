      <h1>Assignment DE.SVG.0</h1>
      <p>Create an HTML5 page with a 400 x 200 pixel SVG inlined.</p>
      <p>The SVG must contain a yellow 10 pixel radius disk in the middle.</p>
      <p>It must also have blue ellipsis drawn so that its horisontal and vertical minimum and maximum coordinates are just 10 pixel inside the size of the SVG viewbox.</p>
      <p>The SVG background color must be black. You must code the SVG by hand. No drawing programs allowed.</p>
      <div>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 400 200">
            <!-- circle in the middle -->
            <circle cx='200' cy='100' r='10'stroke='yellow' stroke-width='0' fill='yellow'/>
            <!-- elipse with max 10px to borders -->
            <ellipse cx='200' cy='100' rx='186' ry='86' stroke='blue' fill='transparent' stroke-width='2'/>
        </svg>
      </div>

      <h3>What is a viewbox?</h3>
      <p>The viewBox can be thought of as much like the viewport but with two extra features: it can “pan” and it can “zoom”. Building on the “looking through glass” analogy, if the viewport is like a window, the viewBox is like a telescope.</p>
      <h3>What is a viewport?</h3>
      <p>It is a “port” through which you can “view” a section of an SVG. You can imagine this as being something akin to a porthole window through which you can see the world beyond.</p>
      <p>As with a window, the size of the viewport determines how much you can see, but it doesn’t define the size of whatever might be visible through that viewport. What’s on the other side could theoretically be any size at all.</p>
      <h3>How do they relate to each other?</h3>
      <p>Whenever you use the viewBox attribute, remember to set your viewport dimensions too. If you don’t, they’ll default to 100% and you’ll likely have an oversized graphic</p>
      <h3>How to scale an SVG drawing's apperance on a web page?</h3>
